  I went to an in-person workshop in Miami for the first time since the pandemic!

### Quantile Regression and Data Heterogeneity Workshop

The program agenda can be found [here](https://herbert.miami.edu/_assets/pdfs/faculty-research/business-conferences/quantile-regression-and-data-heterogeneity-workshop/workshop_program_updated.pdf).

All the talks were very nice, and here I am saving a few of the talks that I found especially interesting!

**Dr. Regina Yu** (Rutgers University) Fusion learning: combine inferences from diverse data sources with heterogeneous data. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07047)

**Dr. Kean Ming Tan** (University of Michigan) Convolution-type smoothing approach for quantile regression. [[paper]](http://www.keanmingtan.com/uploads/8/1/6/7/81678836/sqr_main.pdf)
